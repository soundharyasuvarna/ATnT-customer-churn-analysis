ATnT Customer Churn Prediction

1.1 Introduction
ATnT receives a lot of customers who subscribe to their service to get access to the fastest possible communication access through mobile and internet services. There are diverse set of applications which ATnT gives to their users such as mobile services and communication tools to name a few.

One of the challenges that the company faces is to get to know beforehand whether a customer who has activated a service under ATnT is going to leave or stay in the service (churn). If they know that a customer is going to leave the service based on a set of factors such as Gender and whether they are Senior citizen or not, they can come up with affordable plans or give promotional offers so that they retain the customer without them having to move to options from other companies.

1.2 Machine Learning and Data Science
There are a lot of technologies and tools which are build with the aid of machine learning and data science. Considering that the data size is large and has useful features, it is possible to gain insights from the data and make predictions. After performing sufficient training and hyperparameter tuning, it is possible to get the best predictions for our models.

We try to combat the challenge by ATnT with the aid of data science and machine learning. We take the output variable (Customer Churn) and we try to build the models for prediction with diverse set of features respectively.

1.3 Metrics
Since we are working on a classification problem, we need to ensure we select the metrics that are useful for these problems. Below are the metrics that we are going to be using for our problem.

Log Loss
